## Introduction

Telegraf-CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to simplify the development process for developers who are working with the Telegraf library. The Telegraf library is a popular framework for building Telegram bots, and Telegraf-CLI provides developers with a streamlined way to generate boilerplate code for their projects and to generate bot commands.

With Telegraf-CLI, developers can save time and effort by automating the creation of basic project structures and boilerplate code. This means they can focus more on the development of their Telegram bots, rather than spending time setting up their development environment.

2. JavaScript Template/Boilerplate (**TypeScript** coming soon)
